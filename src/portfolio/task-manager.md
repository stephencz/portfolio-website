Task Manager is a full stack web application I created to help track, organize, and manage the tasks I need to complete.
The application allows the user to create tasks, and organize those tasks using custom tags and deadlines.
Tasks can be sorted and filtered by description, tag, or deadline to only show whats relevant.

The four chief technologies used in this project were **React**, **Redux**, **Node.js**, and **Express.js**.
React and Redux were used to design the frontend user interface.
While Node.js and Express.js were used to create a backend **REST API** for performing standard CRUD operations on the task and tag resources.
