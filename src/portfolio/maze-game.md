Maze Game is a game which is capable of generating square and hexagonal mazes that the user has to escape.
I created the game using **Java** and the **LibGDX** game development framework. 
During the project I made heavy use of **Object-Oriented Programming** technqiues and advanced Java language features such as generic types.
Additionally, I implemented highly abstracted versions of a backtracking algorithm and the Aldous-Broder algorithm to generate mazes composed of any 2D shape with three or more sides.
