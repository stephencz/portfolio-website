Wordathon is a take on the popular word game [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle).
Unlike Wordle, which only gives the player one puzzle a day, Wordathon challenges the user to solve several puzzles in a row to build
up a streak. Additionally, the game features difficulty levels to make the game more, or less, challenging.

The two technologies at the core of Wordathon are **React** and **Redux**.
