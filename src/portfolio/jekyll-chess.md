Jekyll Chess is a plugin for the static website generator **Jekyll** which can generate static chessboards from FEN Notation.
FEN Notation is a standard for representing the state of a chessboard on a single turn of a game. 
For this plugin I used **Ruby** and its support for the **Object Oriented Programming** paradigm to parse FEN Notation, create a representation of a chessboard in memory, and then render that chessboard as an **HTML** table.
Finally, I used **SASS** to style the **HTML** table to make it look like a real chessboard.
